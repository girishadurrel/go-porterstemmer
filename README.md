# Go Porter Stemmer

This is a GO implementation of the porter stemmer 2 algorithm. I forked the
porter stemmer algorithm from this repo and then changed the code to reflect
Porter 2. The Porter 2 implementation in this algorithm is directly based upon
the code found in this repo. If you are looking for a Porter 2 implementation in
Go please refer to the original repo.
