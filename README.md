# Go Porter (2) Stemmer

This is a GO implementation of the porter stemmer 2 algorithm. I forked the porter stemmer algorithm from this [repo](https://github.com/magiczhao/go-porterstemmer) and then changed the code to reflect Porter 2. The Porter 2 implementation in this algorithm is directly based upon the code found in this [repo](https://github.com/kljensen/snowball). If you are looking for a Porter 2 implementation in GO please refer to the original [repo](https://github.com/kljensen/snowball).
